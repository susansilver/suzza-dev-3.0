title: Creating Tag Archives
description: Information on creating a tag archive that uses pagination in Astro.

Tags took me so long to figure out. It stumped me for a long time. I thought it should be fairly simple. It turns out, it was my code that needed refactoring. There were two discoveries that I needed to make to understand what went wrong


## A Tag Archive

Per usual, it started with a Google Search. I found this article by Nicholas C. Zakas. It discusses[ how to make a Jekyll-style archive by year](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2023/02/astro-jekyll-blog-year-archive/). This wasn’t quite what I was looking for but it worked. 

This adds tagged blog posts to their own archive without pagination. There would be no pages to make browsing the website easier. I wanted to match my blog with six posts per page.


## Adding Pagination

Sometimes, I stroll through the free themes for Astro. This helps me understand it more. Looking at other people’s code is helpful. 

I was looking at the [Astro Ink theme](https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-ink). There is a link there to a blog by Aftab Alam, the creator, who [wrote about building data-driven pages](https://aalam.in/blog/astro-and-dynamic-pages).

This whole article is about creating Tag archives in Astro! I finally understood what I needed to do to make it work. Finding the right tutorial changes your world. 


## The Takeaway

You need to look at what other front-end devs are doing. There are people out there who are [making videos and articles](https://github.com/one-aalam/awesome-astro) about Astro. We are up to Astro 3.0 now and the team keeps adding in new features. Learning is a never-ending process.
