There is a wide [variety of integrations ](https://astro.build/integrations/)for Astro. I use only a few. Here are the ones that I suggest.



1. [Astro-pagefind](https://github.com/shishkin/astro-pagefind)- Search for static sites
2. [Astro-compress](https://github.com/astro-community/AstroCompress#readme) - Compresses your CSS, HTML, JS, SVG, and Image files. 
3. [Astro-compressor](https://github.com/sondr3/astro-compressor) - gzip compressor
4. [Astro-sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) - Generates a sitemap for your site which you can use in Google Search Console or Bing Webmaster Tools
5. [RSS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/) - Generates an [rss feed](https://aboutfeeds.com/) allowing people to subscribe with a feed reader like Feedly.
